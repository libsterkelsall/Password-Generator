Here is the link to my Password Generator:  https://libsterkelsall.github.io/Password-Generator/

Started earlier and much more organised than last week but still found this complex.

Required to update HTML and CSS files and empower with JavaScipt code to create an application that generates a random password based on the User's selected length, between 8 - 128, and selected range of characters.

I have used a lot of confirms to validate the requested information.

The form does not reset after generation.

Loaded picture in social on settings again - can't seem to get it in here.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
***Would have like to insert a slider in the prompt for password length but overwhelmed with complexity of that.  Could insert into html but my interpretation of instructions is that the selection be by prompt and so popup.  Also be great to have buttons to select different character arrays but I think I need jQuery ***

***Thought about ensuring compliance with input of minimum 8 password length with prompt to try again BUT have enough things to work out ***

***Reset form after a password is generated for a second generation if desired ***
